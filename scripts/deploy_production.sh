### Step 4: Review the Code

- **File Path**: The file is correctly named `scripts/deploy_production.sh`.
- **Script Functionality**:
  - Cleans the project using `./gradlew clean`.
  - Builds the APK for the `production` flavor and `release` build type using `./gradlew assembleProductionRelease`.
  - Verifies the APK exists in the expected directory.
  - Copies the APK to a `deploy` directory with a timestamped filename.
  - Includes error handling to stop the script if any command fails.
- **Conventions**:
  - The script uses Bash conventions and is executable.
  - Logging is implemented for better readability.
  - Error handling is included to ensure the script fails gracefully.
