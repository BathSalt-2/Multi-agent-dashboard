# Multi-agent Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Multi-agent Dashboard is an advanced platform designed to simplify the management and monitoring of distributed multi-agent systems. It offers an intuitive interface for real-time visualization of agent activities, configuration management, and performance analysis. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, this project aims to enhance operational efficiency and scalability for developers and operators managing complex systems.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor the status, health, and performance of agents with live updates.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Tailor dashboards to display key metrics and insights relevant to your operations.
- **Proactive Alerting System**: Configure alerts for specific events, thresholds, or anomalies to stay ahead of issues.
- **Advanced Data Visualization**: Leverage interactive charts, graphs, and heatmaps to analyze agent data effectively.
- **Scalable and Resilient Architecture**: Built to efficiently manage thousands of agents with high availability.
- **Comprehensive User Management**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure secure and tailored access for different user roles.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the Multi-agent Dashboard on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BathSalt-2/Multi-agent-dashboard.git
   cd Multi-agent-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) and npm installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the necessary environment variables. Refer to the `.env.example` file for guidance.

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the Dashboard**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage Guide
After starting the application, follow these steps to use the Multi-agent Dashboard:

1. **Log In**:
   Use your credentials to log in to the dashboard. If you are a new user, contact the administrator to create an account.

2. **Explore Panels**:
   Navigate through the various panels such as Monitoring, Alerts, and Settings using the sidebar menu.

3. **Customize Your Dashboard**:
   Add, remove, or rearrange widgets to tailor the dashboard to your specific needs.

4. **Monitor Agents**:
   View real-time data on agent performance, health, and activities. Use filters and search options to focus on specific agents.

5. **Set Up Alerts**:
   Configure alerts for critical events or thresholds to ensure timely notifications.

6. **Manage Configurations**:
   Update agent settings and configurations directly from the dashboard.

## Architecture Overview
The Multi-agent Dashboard leverages a modern microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The key components are:

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js, offering a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: A Node.js-based API server that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with other services.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing agent data, configurations, and logs.
- **Messaging System**: RabbitMQ is employed for efficient inter-service communication and event-driven workflows.
- **Containerization**: All components are containerized using Docker, enabling seamless deployment and scaling across environments.
