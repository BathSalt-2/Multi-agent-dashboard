# Multi-agent Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Multi-agent Dashboard is a sophisticated platform designed to manage and monitor multiple agents in a distributed system. It provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing agent activities, managing configurations, and analyzing performance metrics. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the management of complex multi-agent systems, making it easier for developers and operators to maintain and optimize their operations.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track the status and performance of agents in real-time.
- **Configurable Dashboards**: Customize dashboards to display relevant metrics and information.
- **Alerting System**: Set up alerts for specific events or thresholds.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize charts and graphs to visualize agent data.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle a large number of agents efficiently.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control for different user types.

## Installation Instructions
To install the Multi-agent Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BathSalt-2/Multi-agent-dashboard.git
   cd Multi-agent-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables as per the `.env.example` file.

4. **Start the Application**:

   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the Dashboard**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage Guide
Once the application is running, you can log in using your credentials. The dashboard provides various panels and tools to manage and monitor agents. Use the navigation menu to access different sections such as Monitoring, Alerts, and Settings. Customize your dashboard by adding or removing widgets as needed.

## Architecture Overview
The Multi-agent Dashboard is built using a microservices architecture. The main components include:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js-based API server handling requests and data processing.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing agent data and configurations.
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ facilitates communication between services.

Each component is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.
